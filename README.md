A web App which allows a customer to book a table at a particular restaurant for a particular time slot(with offers). Hotels can register on our website and provide an online table booking facility for its customers.    
This app was developed with an intention to make it easier for customers to book a table during rush timings.  
Also it helped Restaurants owners to get more customers by having online presence and easier management of the business transactions with our app features such as Analytics and Report Generation.  
  
## Features :  
1.) **Register and login** for customers and Restaurants.  
3.) **List Restaurant** with its details and offers on the website (for restaurant manager).  
4.) **Book table** at a restaurant (for website user i.e. customer).  
5.) **Cancel** the table booking if plan changes.  
6.) **Analytics** for the restaurant manager to improve their services and promotions.  
7.) **Feedback features(star ratings)** for customers to help restaurants improve their services.  
8.) **Report(with PDF)** generation for restaurants ( daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).  
  
  
> PS : I also have recently done a **project internship** where I worked as a backend developer.  
Where I developed Several RESTful APIs for a food ordering Android app using Spring Boot and MongoDB.  
I have that code(in a private repo) but we are not allowed to share that code.  
But you can get more details by going through my performance report(verified by the company) -   https://criodo.github.io/csod-2019-adarsh456
